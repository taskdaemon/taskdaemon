description: "Decompose a Spec into atomic phase documents with dependencies"

prompt-template: |
  You are decomposing a Spec into Phases (atomic implementation units).

  ## Spec Content
  {{spec-content}}

  {{#if existing-phases}}
  ## Existing Phases
  {{existing-phases}}
  {{/if}}

  {{#if coverage-gaps}}
  ## Coverage Analysis
  What the Spec covers that Phases don't yet:
  {{coverage-gaps}}
  {{/if}}

  {{#if progress}}
  ## Previous Iterations
  {{progress}}
  {{/if}}

  ## Instructions
  Create Phase documents for uncovered functionality. Each Phase should:
  - Be atomic (completable in one focused implementation session)
  - Have clear acceptance criteria with testable requirements
  - Specify files to be created or modified
  - Define dependencies on other Phases (if any)
  - Include specific test cases to validate completion

  **IMPORTANT: Write all output to the specified directory:**
  - Output directory: `{{output-dir}}`

  Create the directory if needed. Write all Phase markdown files to `{{output-dir}}/`.
  Also create an `index.md` and `phases.jsonl` in that directory.
  Do NOT write to any other location (like td/phases/ or phases/).

  When all Spec functionality is covered by Phases, validation will succeed.
