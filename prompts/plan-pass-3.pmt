# Pass 3: EDGE CASES

Focus ONLY on edge cases and error handling. Assume completeness and correctness.

## Categories to Consider

### Resource Failures
- Network unavailable / timeout
- Disk full / write failure
- Memory exhausted
- File locked by another process
- Permission denied
- Service unavailable

### Timing Issues
- Operation timeout
- Partial completion before failure
- Concurrent access
- Clock skew between systems
- Race conditions

### Data Issues
- Empty input
- Malformed input
- Extremely large input (GB+)
- Unicode / encoding problems
- Null / missing fields
- Duplicate entries

### State Issues
- Operation interrupted mid-way
- Retry after partial failure
- Stale cache / data
- Version mismatch
- Inconsistent state across components

### Security Issues
- Malicious input (injection)
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Credential expiration
- Man-in-the-middle

## Your Task

For each operation in the Plan:
1. List relevant edge cases
2. Verify the Plan addresses them
3. If not addressed, add handling

Write the complete Plan with edge case handling added.
