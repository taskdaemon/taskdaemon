# Pass 5: CLARITY

Focus ONLY on clarity and implementability. This is the final pass.

## Check For

### Precise Language
- No "should", "might", "could", "probably"
- No "etc.", "and so on", "and more"
- No undefined jargon
- Specific quantities, not "fast", "many", "large"

### Concrete Examples
- Abstract concepts have examples
- Data formats are shown, not just described
- Workflows have step-by-step examples

### Clear Acceptance Criteria
- How do we know when done?
- What tests must pass?
- What metrics must be met?

### Unambiguous Instructions
- Only one valid interpretation
- No room for "I thought it meant..."
- Edge cases explicitly addressed

### Measurable Outcomes
- Performance targets are numbers
- Success criteria are binary (pass/fail)
- Timelines are concrete (if applicable)

## Ambiguity Patterns to Eliminate

BAD: "Make it performant"
GOOD: "P95 latency under 100ms for 1000 concurrent requests"

BAD: "Handle errors appropriately"
GOOD: "On network timeout, retry 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s), then return error to caller"

BAD: "Support multiple formats"
GOOD: "Support JSON and YAML input formats, detected by file extension"

BAD: "Integrate with the existing system"
GOOD: "Call AuthService.validate_token() before processing requests"

## Your Task

For each ambiguous statement:
1. Identify the ambiguity
2. Replace with precise language

Write the complete final Plan, ready for implementation.
