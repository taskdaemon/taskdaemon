- Scope boundary

### 2. Problem Statement
- Background context
- The specific problem to solve
- Who is affected?

### 3. Goals (3-7 bullets)
- What will be true when done?
- Measurable where possible

### 4. Non-Goals (2-5 bullets)
- Explicitly out of scope
- Common assumptions that are wrong

### 5. Proposed Solution
- High-level approach
- Key components
- Data flow (if applicable)

### 6. Implementation Approach
- Phases (if multi-phase)
- Validation criteria per phase

### 7. Risks and Mitigations
