# Pass 2: CORRECTNESS

Focus ONLY on correctness. Assume completeness was verified in Pass 1.

## Check For

### Logical Errors
- Does the proposed solution actually solve the stated problem?
- Are the phases in the right order?
- Do dependencies make sense?

### Invalid Assumptions
- Are we assuming APIs/features that don't exist?
- Are we assuming behavior that isn't guaranteed?
- Are we assuming resources that may not be available?

### Technical Feasibility
- Can this actually be built as described?
- Are the technologies mentioned appropriate?
- Are performance claims realistic?

### Consistency
- Do different sections contradict each other?
- Are terms used consistently?
- Do numbers add up?

### Dependency Correctness
- Are all dependencies actually needed?
- Are dependency versions compatible?
- Are there circular dependencies?

## Your Task

For each error found:
1. Identify the specific error
2. Explain why it's wrong
3. Fix it in the Plan

Write the complete corrected Plan.
