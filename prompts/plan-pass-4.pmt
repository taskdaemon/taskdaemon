# Pass 4: ARCHITECTURE

Focus ONLY on architectural fit. Assume completeness, correctness, edge cases handled.

## Check For

### Consistency with Existing Patterns
- Does this follow established conventions in the codebase?
- Are naming patterns consistent?
- Does the module structure match existing code?
- Are similar problems solved the same way?

### Integration Points
- Where does this connect to existing code?
- Are those interfaces stable?
- Will this break existing functionality?
- Are there version compatibility concerns?

### Scalability Implications
- Will this work at 10x scale? 100x?
- Are there bottlenecks being created?
- Is state management appropriate?
- Are there single points of failure?

### Technical Debt
- Is this creating shortcuts that will need fixing?
- Are we duplicating existing functionality?
- Are we over-engineering for current needs?
- Will this be hard to change later?

### Maintainability
- Can someone else understand and modify this?
- Are responsibilities clearly separated?
- Is the complexity justified?
- Are there adequate extension points?

## Your Task

For each architectural concern:
1. Identify the specific issue
2. Explain the impact if not addressed
3. Update the Plan with fixes or explicit trade-off documentation

Write the complete Plan with architectural concerns addressed.
